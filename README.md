> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** Though most linux (debian/fedora/arch base) distros are supported but not all packages are tested on all these platforms, to save some time (and brain cells) and ship the software as fast as possible! (Currently only the debian package is tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS - So, other linux packages may have issues, test it yourself and feel free to report issues if you found one)

### ü§ù External Dependencies

- [Aria2](https://aria2.github.io) - Used as an external downloader for blazing fast downloads with yt-dlp (Not included with NeoDLP MacOS builds)
- [Deno](https://deno.com) - Provides sandboxed javascript runtime environment for yt-dlp (Required for YT downloads, as per the new yt-dlp [announcement](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14404))

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Download and Installation
