> ‚ö†Ô∏è MacOS ARM64 binary downloads are experimental and may not open on Apple Silicon Macs if downloaded from browser (You will get 'Damaged File' error) it's because the binaries are not signed (signing MacOS binaries requires 99$/year Apple Developer Account subscription, which I can't afford RN!) and Apple Silicon Macs don't allow unsigned apps (downloaded from browser) to be installed on the system. If you want to use NeoDLP on your Apple Silicon Macs, you can simply use the command line [Curl-Bash Installer](https://neodlp.neosubhamoy.com/download) (Recommended) -OR- [compile it from source](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/neodlp?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-contributing--building-from-source) in your Mac
