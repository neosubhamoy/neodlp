### üìù Notes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Linux Users: Make sure yt-dlp is not installed in your distro (otherwise you will get package installation conflict). Don't worry, You can still use yt-dlp cli as before (the only difference is that now it will be installed and auto-updated by neo-dlp, which You can also disable from neo-dlp Settings if you don't want to auto-update yt-dlp)

> This is an Un-Signed Build (Windows doesn't trust this Certificate so, it may flag this as malicious software, in that case, disable Windows SmartScreen and Defender, install it, and then re-enable them)

> This is an Un-Signed Build (MacOS doesn't trust this Certificate so, it may flag this as from 'unverified developer' and prevent it from opening, in that case, open Settings and allow it from 'Settings > Privacy and Security' section to get started)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è MacOS ARM64 binary downloads are experimental and may not open on Apple Silicon Macs if downloaded from browser (You will get 'Damaged File' error) it's because the binaries are not signed (signing MacOS binaries requires 99$/year Apple Developer Account subscription, which I can't afford RN!) and Apple Silicon Macs don't allow unsigned apps (downloaded from browser) to be installed on the system. If you want to use NeoDLP on your Apple Silicon Macs, you can simply use the command line [Curl-Bash Installer](https://neodlp.neosubhamoy.com/download) (Recommended) -OR- [compile it from source](https://github.com/neosubhamoy/neodlp?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-contributing--building-from-source) in your Mac
